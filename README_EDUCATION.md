---

## 📍 URLS AFTER SETUP

## 🔒 Access Control (Guest vs Registered)

- Guests (not logged in) can access: `/learn` (hub) and `/learn/fundamentals` (teaser lesson).
- Registered/logged-in users unlock: all lessons, interactive tools, quizzes, progress tracking, and certificates.
- Direct navigation to locked routes redirects to `/learn/login?next=...`.

## 🔁 Password Resets (Email)

- Registration now requires an email address (used for password reset).
- `/learn/forgot-password` asks for username, then emails a one-time reset link to the email stored on that account.

### Gmail SMTP (App Password)

Set these environment variables before running the app (or in your host dashboard like Render/Heroku):

```powershell
$env:SMTP_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
$env:SMTP_PORT = "587"
$env:SMTP_USERNAME = "youraccount@gmail.com"
$env:SMTP_PASSWORD = "your16charapppassword"    # Gmail app password (spaces ok too)
$env:SMTP_FROM = "youraccount@gmail.com"        # optional
```

Notes:
- Use a Gmail **App Password** (requires 2FA on the Google account). Do not use your normal Gmail password.
- In development, the app may still show the reset link on-screen if `EDU_SHOW_RESET_LINK` is enabled in Flask config.

```

## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS TAUGHT

### Cell Health
```
GOOD CELL:                     BAD CELL:
✓ Smooth voltage curve         ✗ Rapid voltage drop
✓ Consistent capacity          ✗ Lost capacity (< 80%)
✓ Minimal voltage sag          ✗ Excessive heat
✓ Quick recovery               ✗ Doesn't recover
✓ Low internal resistance      ✗ High resistance
```

### DOD Impact on Cycle Life
```
LiFePO4:
  100% DOD = 2,000 cycles
   80% DOD = 2,500 cycles
   50% DOD = 4,000+ cycles

Li-ion:
  100% DOD = 500 cycles
   80% DOD = 700 cycles
   50% DOD = 1,200+ cycles
```

### C-Rate Effects
```
Higher C-rate = Less capacity available

  0.2C (slow):      100% capacity
  1.0C (normal):    95% capacity
  2.0C (fast):      90% capacity
  5.0C (very fast): 75% capacity
```
