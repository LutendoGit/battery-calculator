```python
from routes.education_routes import education_bp
app.register_blueprint(education_bp)
```

### Step 2: Create Folders
```bash
mkdir modules routes
mkdir templates/education
touch modules/__init__.py routes/__init__.py
```

### Step 3: Copy Files
- Copy `lithium_education.py` → `modules/`
- Copy `interactive_tools.py` → `modules/`
- Copy `education_routes.py` → `routes/`
- Copy 10 HTML templates → `templates/education/`

**Done!** ✨

## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS

### Good Cell Characteristics
✓ Smooth voltage decline  
✓ Consistent capacity  
✓ Minimal voltage sag  
✓ Quick recovery  

### Bad Cell Warning Signs
✗ Rapid voltage drop  
✗ Lost capacity (< 80%)  
✗ Excessive heat  
✗ Doesn't recover  

### DOD Impact on Cycle Life
```
LiFePO4:  100% DOD = 2,000 cycles
          80% DOD = 2,500 cycles
          50% DOD = 4,000+ cycles

Li-ion:   100% DOD = 500 cycles
          80% DOD = 700 cycles
          50% DOD = 1,200+ cycles
```

### C-Rate Effects
```
0.2C (slow):     100% capacity
1.0C (normal):   95% capacity
2.0C (fast):     90% capacity
5.0C (very fast): 75% capacity
```
